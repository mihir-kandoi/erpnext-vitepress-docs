# Timesheet

**A Timesheet is the record of the number of hours spent by an employee on completion of each task.**

The Timesheet can also be used to calculate the billable towards an employee, to calculate their salaries, or to track an employee's contribution towards a Project or a Task.

In ERPNext, a Timesheet can have an account of a particular employee working on multiple Tasks or Projects in a tabular format.

To access Timesheet, go to,

> Home > Projects > Time Tracking > Timesheet
