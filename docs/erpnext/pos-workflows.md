# POS Workflows

### **POS Workflows**

#### **Open POS Session**

1. Go to **Point of Sale** workspace.
2. Select a **POS Profile**.
3. Select Customer.
4. Add items from the item list.
5. Edit quantities as needed.

_Note:_ You need to set a default Warehouse for stock impact. If both Item and POS Profile define a Warehouse, the POS profile warehouse gets priority.

**How to Create a POS Invoice**

**POS Opening Entry**

Before selling, open a session with an **Opening Entry**.

1. Go to **POS Closing Entry**
2. Select the POS Profile and closing period
