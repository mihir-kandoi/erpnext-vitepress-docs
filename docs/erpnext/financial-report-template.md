# Financial Report Template

## What are Financial Report Templates?

Financial Report Templates help create professional financial reports automatically that fit dynamic business needs. Instead of editing reports in Excel, one can set up a template and it will generate reports like Balance Sheets, Profit &amp; Loss statements, and Cash Flow reports with just a few clicks.

## Main Components

### 1. Financial Report Template

This is a report blueprint that defines:

- **Template Name**: Descriptive name for identification (e.g., "Monthly P&amp;L")
- **Report Type**: Balance Sheet, Profit &amp; Loss, Cash Flow, or Custom
- **Rows**: The individual lines that make up the report

### 2. Financial Report Row (Child Table)

Each row in template represents a line in the financial report:

- **Display Name**: What appears in the report (e.g., "Total Revenue")
- **Reference Code**: Short code for calculations (e.g., REV100)
- **Data Source**: Where the numbers come from:
  - **Account Data**: Pulls balances from Chart of Accounts
  - **Calculated Amount**: Uses formulas to compute values based on other rows
  - **Visual Elements**: Blank lines or section headers for formatting
- **Formatting**: Bold, colors, indentation for professional appearance

### 3. Account Category

Classification system for accounts that enables standardized filtering across companies.

Examples:

- **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: Bank accounts, cash, short-term deposits
- **Trade Receivables**: Customer invoices and receivables
- **Operating Expenses**: Office rent, utilities, salaries
- **Revenue from Operations**: Sales and service income

## How to Get Data for Report

### 1. Account Data - Pull from Chart of Accounts

This gets actual balances from accounts. One can filter accounts by category or specific criteria.

**Simple Example**: Get all cash balances

- Set filter to: `Cash and Cash Equivalents` category
- Choose balance type: `Closing Balance` (balance at end of period)

**Advanced Example**: Get only sales-related expenses

- Filter: Operating Expenses that contain "Sales" in the name
- This might include: "Sales Commission", "Sales Travel", "Sales Training"

**Balance Types Explained:**

- **Opening Balance**: Balance at the start of the period
- **Closing Balance**: Balance at the end of the period
- **Period Movement**: How much changed during the period

Easily check account coverage for rows to ensure all relevant accounts are included.

### 2. Calculated Amount

Use this to add, subtract, or calculate percentages using other rows in template.

**Simple Examples:**

- **Total Assets**: `CURRENT_ASSETS + NON_CURRENT_ASSETS`
- **Gross Profit**: `REVENUE - COST_OF_GOODS_SOLD`
- **Profit Margin**: `(NET_PROFIT / REVENUE) * 100`

**Smart Calculations** (prevents division by zero):

- `(GROSS_PROFIT / REVENUE) * 100 if REVENUE != 0 else 0`

### 3. Visual Elements

**Blank Line**: Add space between sections for better readability. Display name can still be given. Eg: Bold Text like "ASSETS" or "LIABILITIES" to organize report.

**Column Break**: Create multi-column or horizontal layouts. Display name acts as the header for the new column.

**Section Headers**: Used in conjunction with Column Breaks to separate different sections horizontally. Eg. Keep Totals aligned with each other in multi-column layouts.

### How to Assign Categories to Accounts

**Method 1: One by One** Go to Accounts -> update Account Category field

**Method 2: Bulk Assignment** using Data Import Tool

## Making Reports Look Professional

### Text Formatting

Make reports easy to read and professional:

- **Bold Text**: Say for main headings like "TOTAL ASSETS" or "NET PROFIT"
- **Italic Text**: Say for subtotals and calculated amounts
- **Colors**: Highlight important figures (red for losses, green for profits)
- **Indentation**: Create visual hierarchy (main items flush left, sub-items indented)
- **Hide Empty Rows**: Don't show accounts with zero balances to keep reports clean
- **Reverse Signs**: Show expenses as positive numbers (makes P&amp;L easier to read)
- **Include in Charts**: Select which rows to include in automatic chart generation

### Advanced Features

Easily build advanced templates by adding calculated rows

**Balance Validation**:

Say add a check that Assets = Liabilities + Equity

**Ratios**:

- **Current Ratio**: Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities
- **Profit Margin**: Net Profit ÷ Revenue × 100
- **Debt Ratio**: Total Debt ÷ Total Equity

## Built-in Validations

The system automatically checks your templates to prevent errors:

### What Gets Checked

**Reference Codes**:

- Must be unique (can't have two REV100 codes)
- Must start with a letter and contain only letters, numbers, and underscores
- Example:
  - ✅ REV100, ASSET1
  - ❌ 100REV, ASSET-1

**Calculations**:

- Checks that references to a row actually exist
- Prevents circular references (A depends on B, B depends on A)
- Makes sure parentheses match up:
  - ✅ `(A + B) * C`
  - ❌ `(A + B * C`

**Account Filters**:

- Verifies that account categories exist
- Checks filter syntax is correct
