### 1. Over Billing Allowance (%)

The percentage by which you can overbill transactions. For example, if the order value is $100 for an Item and percentage here is set as 10% then you are allowed to bill for $110.

### 2. Role Allowed to Over Bill

Users with this role are allowed to over bill above the allowance percentage.

### 3. Check Supplier Invoice Number Uniqueness

When checked, Purchase Invoices with same 'Supplier Invoice No' will not be allowed. This is useful to avoid duplicate entries.

### 4. Unlink Payment on Cancellation of Invoice

If checked, system will unlink the payment against the respective invoice. By default, if a Payment Entry is submitted, the linked invoice cannot be canceled until the Payment Entry is also canceled. On unlinking, you can now cancel and amend the invoices. But the payments not be linked and considered as advance payments.

### 5. Automatically Fetch Payment Terms from Order

The _Automatically Fetch Payment Terms from Order_ setting in **Accounts Settings** controls whether payment terms and schedules are automatically copied from **Sales Orders**/**Purchase Orders** to their respective invoices.

When enabled (checked):

- **Sales Invoice** & **Purchase Invoice** automatically inherit payment schedules from linked orders
- Due dates are recalculated based on the invoice posting date (not order date)
- Payment amounts are recalculated based on invoice grand total (not order total)
- Sets `ignore_default_payment_terms_template = 1` to prevent Company defaults from overriding
- Requires all invoice items to reference the same order

When disabled (unchecked):

- Payment terms are NOT fetched from linked orders
- Falls back to Company-level payment terms or manual entry
- More manual configuration required

### 6. Delete Accounting and Stock Ledger Entries on deletion of Transaction

Enabling this will allow the deletion of linked General Ledger and Stock Ledger Entries on deleting invoices and receipts. This can be checked if you don't want to lose the document ID after cancelling the document. You can now cancel and delete the document to get the same document ID again.

### 7. Book Asset Depreciation Entry Automatically

When checked, an automatic entry for an asset depreciation will be created based on the first date set. For example, yearly depreciation for an item will be scheduled for the next 3/4 years based on the Number of Depreciations Booked set in the Asset master. For more details, visit the [Asset Depreciation](/erpnext/asset-depreciation) page.

### 8. Unlink Advance Payment on Cancellation of Order

Similar to the previous option, this unlinks any advance payments made against Purchase/Sales Orders.

### 9. Enable Common Party Accounting

If checked, an adjustment Journal Entry will be posted automatically on creation of Sales/Purchase Invoices against common Customer & Supplier. For more details, visit [Common Party Accounting](/erpnext/common_party_accounting)

### 10. Allow multi-currency invoices against single party account

Enabling this will allow creation of multi-currency invoices against single party account in company currency.

### 11. Create Ledger Entries for Change Amount

If checked, for a Point of Sale invoice, the system will post ledger entries considering the change amount given.

### 12. Enable Discount Accounting

If checked, Discount Accounts can be added in the Items table of Sales Invoices, which will allow you to account for Discounts applied on Items more efficiently. It also lets you add Default Discount Accounts for Items, which will be fetched automatically when the Item is added to a Sales Invoice.

## Tax Settings

## Deferred Accounting Settings

![Screenshot 2024-06-03 at 11.16.37 AM](/files/Screenshot 2024-06-03 at 11.16.37 AM.png)

### 1. Book Deferred Entries Based On

Deferred revenue amount can be booked based on two criteria. The default option here is "Days". If "Days" is selected, the deferred revenue amount will be booked based on the number of days in each month and if "Months" is selected, then it will be booked based on the number of months. **For Eg:** If "Days" is selected and $12000 revenue has to be deferred over a period of 12 months, then $986.30 will be booked for months with 30 days and $1019.17 will be booked for months with 31 days. If "Months" is selected, $1000 deferred revenue will be booked each month irrespective of the number of days in a month.

### 2. Automatically Process Deferred Accounting Entry

This setting is enabled by default. In case you don't want the deferred accounting entries to be posted automatically you can disable this setting. If this setting is disabled deferred accounting will have to be processed manually using [Process Deferred Accounting](/erpnext/process-deferred-accounting)

### 3. Book Deferred Entries Via Journal Entry

By default Ledger Entries are posted directly to book deferred revenue against an invoice. In order to book this deferred amount posting via Journal Entry, this option can be enabled.

It allows you to display the tax amounts inclusive of the item prices on printed documents such as invoices and sales orders.

### 2. Show Taxes as Table in Print

It allows you to display tax details in a tabular format on printed documents such as invoices, purchase orders, and sales orders.

### 3. Show Payment Schedule in Print

The Payment Schedule table is visible on using [Payment Terms](/erpnext/payment-terms). Enabling this will show this table in print view.

## Currency Exchange Settings

![Screenshot 2024-06-03 at 11.22.56 AM](/files/Screenshot 2024-06-03 at 11.22.56 AM.png)

### 1. Allow Stale Exchange Rates

This should be unchecked if you want ERPNext to check the age of records fetched from Currency Exchange in foreign currency transactions. If it is unchecked, the exchange rate field will be read-only in documents.

Stale Days is the number of days to use when deciding if a Currency Exchange record is stale. This is valid when 'Allow Stale Rates' is **disabled**. So, if the Stale Days is set as 10, stale rates that are 10 days will be allowed. If Allow Stale Rates is enabled, there is no time limit on the age of stale rates.

If stale rates are enabled, the order of fetching is:

- Latest rate from Currency Exchange form
- If no Currency Exchange is found latest rate as per market is fetched automatically

If stale rates are disabled, the order of fetching is:

- Latest rate from Currency Exchange form upto number of days set in 'Stale Days'
- If no Currency Exchange is found Latest rate as per market is fetched automatically
