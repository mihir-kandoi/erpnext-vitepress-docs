# Bank Transaction

The **Bank Transaction** form shows bank transactions imported into ERPNext, typically from bank statements or integrations.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before using **Bank Transaction**, it is advised that you create the following first:

1. **[Bank](/erpnext/bank)**
2. **[Bank Account](/erpnext/bank-account)**

## 2. How to use Bank Transaction

A **Bank Transaction** is typically not created manually. It can be imported or created using:

1. **[Bank Statement Import](/erpnext/bank-reconciliation)** — import from CSV or XLSX files
2. **[Data Import](/erpnext/data-import)** — standard data import tool
3. Bank integration apps (e.g., Plaid or other third-party integrations)

Once imported, **Bank Transactions** can be reconciled with vouchers using the **[Bank Reconciliation Tool](/erpnext/bank-reconciliation)**.

## 3. Fields

### 3.1 Basic Information

- _Date_: The date of the bank transaction.
- _Status_: The current status of the transaction:
  - Pending
  - Settled
  - Unreconciled
  - Reconciled
  - Cancelled
- _Bank Account_: The **Bank Account** from which the transaction was made.

### 3.2 Transaction Amount

- _Deposit_: The amount deposited (credited to your account).
- _Withdrawal_: The amount withdrawn (debited from your account).
- _Currency_: The currency in which the transaction was made.

### 3.3 Description and Reference

- _Description_: A description from the bank statement.
- _Reference Number_: A cheque number or other reference.
- _Transaction ID_: A unique identifier from the bank (read-only).
- _Transaction Type_: The type of transaction as reported by the bank.

### 3.4 Payment Entries

The _Payment Entries_ table links the bank transaction to vouchers in ERPNext for reconciliation:

- _Payment Document_: The document type against which the transaction was reconciled, such as **Sales Invoice**, **Purchase Invoice**, **Payment Entry**, **Journal Entry**, or **Expense Claim**.
- _Payment Entry_: The specific document linked to this transaction.
- _Allocated Amount_: The amount allocated from this bank transaction to the payment entry.
- _Clearance Date_: The date when the payment was cleared (shown after submission).

### 3.5 Allocation Summary

- _Allocated Amount_: The total amount that has been allocated to payment entries (read-only).
- _Unallocated Amount_: The remaining amount that has not been allocated (read-only).

### 3.6 Payment From / To (Party Information)

- _Party Type_: The type of party (e.g., Customer, Supplier, Employee).
- _Party_: The specific party linked to this transaction.

The following fields contain party information as provided by the bank statement:

- _Party Name/Account Holder (Bank Statement)_: The party name from the bank statement.
- _Party Account No. (Bank Statement)_: The party's account number from the bank statement.
- _Party IBAN (Bank Statement)_: The party's IBAN from the bank statement.

> Party information from the bank statement can be used for automatic party matching when enabled in **Accounts Settings**.

### 3.7 Extended Bank Statement (Fee Handling)

These fields handle bank fees that may be included in or excluded from the transaction amount:

- _Included Fee_: A fee that is already included within the _Withdrawal_ amount. For example, if a withdrawal of 100 includes a 5 fee, the net payment is 95.
- _Excluded Fee_: A fee that was charged separately from the transaction. On save, this is automatically converted to an _Included Fee_ by adjusting the transaction amount.

> **Note:** Excluded fees adjust the transaction amount: they reduce _Deposit_ or increase _Withdrawal_.
