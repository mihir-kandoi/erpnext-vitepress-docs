# Getting Started

The Project Module in ERPNext is used to track work that involves multiple steps, people, and transactions. A project brings together tasks, time, materials, deliveries, and billing under a single reference.

The example below shows how a simple manufacturing job can be managed as a project and how it connects with other ERPNext modules.

## Scenario**:**

A manufacturing company receives an order to make a **custom metal storage rack** for a warehouse customer.

### **Prerequisites**:

- Create an [Item](/erpnext/item) - Storage Rack

### Step 1: Create a Sales Order for the rack

- To create a sales order, go to:

> Home > Selling > Sales Order

_Sales order with the Storage Rack_

### Step 2: **Create the project from the Sales Order**

- After the sales order is submitted, we can create the project from it

  _Creating project from Sales Order_
- Once the project is created, the dashboard will be created, which will allow the creation of tasks and timesheets

  _Project Dashboard_

### Step 3: **Creating the Basic Tasks for the project**

- We create separate tasks for the project, like cutting and welding, painting, and final assembly.

### **Step 4: Create purchase orders for the raw materials and respective stock entries as well**

- The raw material required for making the Storage rack would be purchased, therefore the purchase order would be made for the same

  _Purchase order for raw material_

### Step 5: **Create a timesheet to record the execution of steel sections and paints**

- To maintain the execution of the steel sections and the painting of the storage rack, we create a timesheet
- The changes made in this project will reflect the costing and billing details

  _Execution details in timesheet_

### **Step 6: As the process continues, we update the task with its progress**

- Once all the tasks are completed, the project moves into a fully completed state as well
