# Asset Category

**Asset Category classifies different assets of a company and sets default accounting and depreciation rules for them.**

The Asset Category DocType helps organize similar assets under a single classification and simplifies asset management. For example, all desktops and laptops can belong to an Asset Category called **“Electronic Equipment”**. Each category can have default depreciation methods, accounting settings, and cost centers, which are automatically applied to all assets in that category.

To access the Asset Category list, go to:

> Home > Asset > Assets > Asset Category

### 2.1 Additional options when creating an Asset Category

1. **Enable Capital Work in Progress Accounting**: On enabling this, accounting entry for assets under this category which are not in use are posted in the Capital Work in Progress accounts. This happens when you own the Asset but it isn't being used yet, i.e. 'Available for Use Date' is set at a later date. If you use all your assets immediately, disable this feature. On disabling this, CWIP accounting will be skipped.
2. **Non Depreciable Category**: On enabling this, depreciation is skipped for assets under this category. Depreciation-related account fields are not required, and no depreciation schedule is generated. Use this for assets like land or other non-depreciable items. Disable if depreciation should apply.Features
