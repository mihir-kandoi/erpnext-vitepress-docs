**An Operation refers to any manufacturing operation performed on the raw materials to process it further in the manufacturing path.**

The Operation master stores a single manufacturing operation, its description and the Default Workstation for the Operation.

## How to create an Operation

1. Go to the Operation list, click on New.
2. Enter a name for the Operation, for example, cutting.
3. Select the Default Workstation where the Operation will be performed. This will be fetched in BOMs and Work Orders.
4. Select a Quality Inspection Template for the operation in the Job Card section. It will be fetched on the Job Card for that particular operation when Work Order is created. When a new Quality Inspection is created from the Job card, then the same Quality Inspection Template is set for the Quality Inspection.
5. Optionally, add a description to describe what the Operation involves.
6. Save.
