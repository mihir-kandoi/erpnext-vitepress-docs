# Opening Balance in Accounts

**The opening balance is the balance that is brought forward at the beginning of an accounting period from the end of a previous accounting period or when starting out.**

This also applies when starting a new Company and would like your offline balances to be updated in ERPNext.

## 1. Introduction

If you are a new company, you will have minimal opening balances to be imported. However, if you are migrating from a legacy accounting system like Tally or a Fox Pro based software you will have considerable data to be imported as opening balance.

We recommend that you start using ERPNext for accounting from a new financial year, but you could start midway too. To set up your accounts, you will need the following for the “day” you start using accounting in ERPNext:

### 1.1 Assets

1. Stock assets (stock in hand).
2. Fixed assets like furnitures, computers, etc.
3. Accounts Receivables (AR) i.e. unpaid invoices which you have sent to your Customers.
4. Current assets like bank balances, cash in hand, deposits, etc.

### 1.2 Liabilities

1. Capital accounts like your shareholder’s (or owner’s) capital
2. Current liabilities like loans, salary payables etc
3. Accounts Payables(AP) i.e. unpaid invoices which your suppliers have sent you

If you were using another accounting software before, you should **close** financial statements in that software first. The closing balance of the accounts should be updated as an opening balance in the ERPNext. Before starting to update opening balance, ensure that your [Chart of Accounts](/erpnext/chart-of-accounts) has all the Accounts required.

Opening entries can be created using the Opening Invoice Creation Tool in ERPNext.

> Opening entry is only for Balance Sheet accounts and not for Profit and Loss Accounts.

### 2.1 Update Fixed Assets

To import all the existing fixed assets first create the asset record and then create a Journal Entry to update the General Ledger.

**Step 1. Create Asset Records**

> To know about Assets in detail, [visit this page](/erpnext/asset).

Create Asset record for each asset that your company owns which is not fully depreciated.

To create a new Asset:

1. Create an [Item](/erpnext/item) with 'Is fixed Asset' enabled.
2. Go to **Assets > Assets > New**.
3. Enter Asset Name.
4. Enter Item Code.
5. Enter Location.
6. Enter the Purchase Date.
7. Enter Gross Amount.
8. Tick **Is Existing Asset.**
9. Save.

**Step 2. Create Journal Entry to Update the Ledgers**

When you create an Asset with 'Is Existing Asset' checkbox ticked, the General Ledger is not updated. You will have to update the value via a Journal Entry.

To create a new Journal Entry:

1. Go to: **Accounting > Masters and Accounts > Journal Entry > New.**
2. Enter Posting Date.
3. Select the appropriate fixed asset ledgers in Account column and enter the value in Debit column.
4. Select 'Temporary Opening' ledger in Account column and enter the balancing amount in Credit column.
5. Set 'Is Opening' to Yes.

### 3.3 Update Accounts Payable

**Accounts Payables is the balance amount you owe your Suppliers towards the invoices they have already sent you.**

You can import the accounts payables details using the [Opening Invoice Creation Tool](/erpnext/opening-invoice-creation-tool).

## 4. Verify the Opening Balance

Once all assets and liabilities have been imported, the balance of **Temporary Opening** ledger should be zero.
