# Asset Capitalization

**Asset Capitalization is a transaction used to combine stock items or existing Assets into a new composite Asset and capitalize all related costs.**

Example Scenario

A company is building a new production line. The production line consists of:

- Conveyor Belt (Stock Item)
- Industrial Motor (Stock Item)
- Control Panel (Stock Item)
- Installation Charges (Service Expense)

Instead of tracking these separately, the company wants to create a single Asset called **“Production Line – Plant A”** and capitalize all component and service costs into one composite Asset.

Asset Capitalization allows you to:

- Combine multiple stock items into one Asset
- Capitalize service and installation costs
- Merge multiple existing Assets into one new Asset
- Automatically generate the correct accounting entries

To access the Asset Capitalization feature, go to:

> Home > Assets > Maintenance > Asset Capitalization

## 1. Convert Stock Items into a New Composite Asset

---

This is used when building a new Asset from inventory items.

### 1.1 Steps

- Go to Asset Capitalization and click New.
- Select the Target Asset (new composite Asset).
- Update if required:
  - Naming Series
  - Company
  - Finance Book
  - Posting Date
- In the Consumed Stock Items table:
  - Add stock items
  - Select Quantity and Warehouse
- Click Save and Submit.
- Open the newly created Asset.
- Set Depreciation Details (if applicable).
- Submit the Asset.

### 1.2 Accounting Effect

- The Consumed Stock Items will be reduced by the selected qty from the selected warehouses and the Warehouse Stock Accounts will be credited with the issued stock value amount.
- The system will first check if the target asset is in CWIP (Capital Work in Progress). If so, the CWIP account will be debited by the total value.
- Upon submission of the target asset, the CWIP account will be credited, and the corresponding Fixed Asset account will be debited.
