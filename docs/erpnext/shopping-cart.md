# Shopping Cart

In addition to listing products, ERPNext also allows selling them via the Shopping Cart.

To enable Shopping Cart, go to:

> E Commerce Settings > [Shopping Cart](/erpnext/e_commerce_settings)

You can even build a **landing page** for your store at a custom route (eg. /_store_).
[Learn More](/erpnext/store-landing-page).

## 1. Item Types

Shopping Cart works differently for Items with and without variants.

### 1.1 Items without variants

Items without variants have their dedicated product page and an **Add to Cart** button.

### 1.2 Items with variants

Since Item Templates can't be bought directly, there is a Configure button to
choose the specific variant and add it to cart.

## 2. Cart Quotation

If checkout is disabled, when your customers add an item to cart, they can click
on the **Request for Quotation** button to get a quote for it. A [Quotation](/erpnext/quotation)
is generated in the system.

## 3. Cart Checkout

You can enable checkout from the [Checkout Settings](/erpnext/e_commerce_settings) section in **E Commerce Settings**.
