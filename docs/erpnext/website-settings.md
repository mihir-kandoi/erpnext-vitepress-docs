## 7. Google Integrations

### 7.1 Google Indexing

#### How to set up automated Google Indexing

In order to allow ERPNext to request Google crawlers to index a web page, you need to authorize ERPNext to send a request whenever the user requests the data. Google Drive Integration is set up with the following steps:

- Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials via [Google Settings](/erpnext/google_settings)

- Enable indexing in the Website Settings

- Now click on **Authorize API Indexing Access** to authorize ERPNext to send a publish request.

- Once Authorized, an indexing request is automatically sent on creation/update/trash of any new blog post or web pages created via the user.

### 7.2 Google Analytics

You can enable Google Analytics on your website. Just get your [Google Analytics
ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en) from your Google
Console and set it here.

By default, Google Analytics will collect the full IP address of your website visitors.
By checking "Google Analytics Anonymize IP", ERPNext will instruct Google Analytics to
anonymize the IP address before it is sent to Google servers. You can find out more about
the effect of this setting in [Google's documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052).

## 8. HTML Header
