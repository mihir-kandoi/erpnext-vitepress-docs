# Asset

**An Asset is any valuable item owned by a company that is used in operations and has a useful life spanning multiple years.**

Examples include furniture, computers, mobile phones, printers, cars, and manufacturing equipment. Assets can be tangible (physical items located at company premises or with employees) or intangible.

An asset's useful life spans across multiple years and hence its economic value is spread over corresponding years from the accounting perspective. If you buy a printer for $300 and it is expected to be useful for three years, from the accounting perspective $100 is recorded as the expense for three years each instead of all the $300 in the first year. Most countries have rules for such calculations.

In ERPNext, the **Asset record** is the core of the Asset Management module. All transactions related to an asset — purchasing, depreciation, maintenance, movement, scrapping, and sales — are recorded against this record.

To access the Asset list, go to:

> Home > Assets > Assets > Asset

## 1. Prerequisites

---

Before creating and using Asset, it is advised to create the following first:

- [Item](/erpnext/item) with 'Is Fixed Asset' enabled.
- [Location](/erpnext/asset-location)
- [Asset Category](/erpnext/asset-category)
- [Purchase Receipt](/erpnext/purchase-receipt) / [Purchase Invoice](/erpnext/purchase-invoice)

## 2. How to create an Asset

---

### 2.1 Prepare the Item

- Create an **Item** representing the asset.
- **‘Maintain Stock’** should be unchecked.
- **‘Is Fixed Asset’** must be checked.

### 2.2 Auto Creation of Assets (Optional)

- Enable **‘Auto Create Assets on Purchase’** in the Item if you want assets to be created automatically upon submission of a **Purchase Receipt**.
- Provide **Asset Location** in the Purchase Receipt item table.
- On submission, ERPNext displays a message confirming that assets have been created.

### 2.3 Manual Creation of Assets

If auto asset creation is not enabled:

1. Go to the Asset list and click New.
2. Enter a Name for the Asset.
3. Select the Item Code.
4. Link the Purchase Receipt/Purchase Invoice (Purchase Date and Gross Purchase Amount auto-filled).
5. Select a Location (e.g., Mumbai).
6. Set Available-for-Use Date — depreciation will start from this date.
7. Click Save and Submit.

> **Note:** One asset record is needed for each individual asset. For example, if you purchased 5 computers in one Purchase Receipt, create 5 separate asset records.

### 2.4 Creating Composite Assets

- A **Composite Asset** can be created from multiple items (e.g., Computer made of Monitor, Keyboard, etc.).
- Select asset type as **‘Composite Asset’** in the Asset form.
- Tag this asset in the **WIP Composite Asset** field of items in Purchase Receipts/Invoices.
- Once all items are received, use **Asset Capitalization** to capitalize the composite asset.
