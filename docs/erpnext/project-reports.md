# Project Reports

These reports help track project progress, project status, and key metrics such as timelines, costs, and resource allocation

## Project Summary

The **Project Summary** provides an overview of key project information, including the current project status, start and end dates, and a consolidated view of related records. It displays the number of associated **Tasks** and **Timesheets**, allowing users to quickly assess project progress and activity at a glance.

## Delayed Task Summary

The Delayed Tasks Summary report helps identify the tasks which have exceeded their Expected End Dates. It provides visibility into both on-track and delayed tasks, along with their current progress and the expected start and end dates, enabling users to identify schedule deviations and take corrective action.

To view this report, you can go to:

> Home > Projects > Reports > Delayed Tasks Summary

The report is generated based on the Task Doctype.

### Calculation of Delay

Tasks have a date field called **Completed On**, which becomes visible when a Tasks status is changed to Completed.

##### Scenario 1

If a task is marked as Completed and the Completed On field is set, then the delay is calculated as the difference between the Completed On and the Expected End Date.

```
Delay = Completed On - Expected End Date
```

##### Scenario 2

If the Completed On field is not set, then the delay is calculated as the difference between the current date and the Expected End Date.

```
Delay = Current Date - Expected End Date
```

### Chart

The chart shows the number of tasks that are On Track or Delayed based on the report generated after applying the filters.
