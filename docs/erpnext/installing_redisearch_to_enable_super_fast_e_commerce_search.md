# Installing RediSearch to enable fast E-commerce Search

> **Experimental**

The E-Commerce module of ERPNext optionally uses RediSearch to enable search functionality which is configurable via **E Commerce Settings**.

Once installed and configured, RediSearch will be used to charge the search functionality of the E-Commerce website. This includes features like fuzzy-word searching, autocomplete, results ranking and customizable field indexing.

### Pre-requisites

1. Frappe Framework + ERPNext Setup
2. Redis 6+

### Installation Instructions

```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch.git
$ cd RediSearch
$ sudo make setup # Remove `sudo` on macOS
$ make build


```

> Please Note: the latest version of RediSearch requires Redis 7.1+, while the stable redis as on 01-Aug-2023 available in snap repos is 7.0. Therefore, Redis need to be compiled from source for Redissearch to be compatible with Redis.
>
> Also note ERPNext requires Redis 6+, therefore using Redis 7.1+ might break thinks. Use Redis 7.1+ with caution.

On successful completion of the above instructions, a `redisearch.so` binary file will be generated in the `RediSearch/build` directory.

Move this binary to the `/etc` directory and restart your Frappe Server:

```
sudo mv build/redisearch.so /etc/


```

Now, open the `redis_cache.conf` file located in the `config` directory (inside the bench directory). Add the following line before the `save ""` line and then restart bench server:

```
loadmodule /etc/redisearch.so


```

This will load the redisearch module at startup. You can check if the module was loaded successfully by running the following command in the `redis-cli -p 13000` (assuming port as 13000 default port for redis in frappe config):

```
> MODULE LIST


```

and `search` should be one of the modules.

You can also load the module on a running redis instance by running the following command in the `redis-cli`:

```
> MODULE LOAD /etc/redisearch.so


```

> We placed the `redisearch.so` module in the `/etc` directory, but it can be placed anywhere in the file system. We have used this directory because in the future the `loadmodule` line will be populated in the config file automatically and it will assume the binary is in the `/etc` directory.
