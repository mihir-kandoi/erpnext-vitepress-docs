**Answer:**

As per the permission system in ERPNext, for the User to be able to access a form or a report, s(he) should have at least read permission on all the link fields in that form/report. Since Territory is a link field in Account Receivable report, please add a permission rule to let Account User/Manager have at-least Read permission on the Territory master. Please follow the steps below to resolve this issue.

1. Roles assigned to User are Account User and Account Manager.
2. As indicates in the Error message, the user didn't have permission on the territory master. As per the default permission, none of the above role assigned to that User has any permission on the Territory master.
3. To resolve this issue, I have assigned Account User permission to Read Territory master.

As per this permission update, the User should be able to access the Account Receivable report.
