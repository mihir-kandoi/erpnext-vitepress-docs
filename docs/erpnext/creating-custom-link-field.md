# Creating Custom Link Field

Link fields are the ones linked to another document type. For example, Customer field is a Link Field in Sales Order. This field is linked to the Customer master.

You can insert Custom Link Field by following the steps below.

#### Step 1: Go to Customize Form

> Home > Customization > Form Customize > Customize Form

#### Step 2: Select Form

In Customize Form, select Document Type (Quotation, Sales Order, Purchase Invoice Item etc.). Once fields are updated in the accompanying table below, open a field above the one you wish to insert your Custom Field. Then click on "Insert Above" to insert the new Custom Field.

## Adding Filters to Link Field

> Note: The feature will be available from version 15 and above.

Frappe provides a user-friendly approach to apply filters on Link Fields using the Form Builder.

You'll notice an action icon on all Link Fields within a Doctype, which gives you the option to select the filters you want to apply.![1](/files/1.png "1.png")

For example, in the case of "Company", clicking on the icon will open a dialogue box where you can choose your desired filters.

Once you've made your selection and clicked on apply, the filtered results will be displayed accordingly.

If you're customizing a form and decide to change the filters, a "Reset To Default" button will appear. Clicking on this will revert the filters back to their original state. **However, it's important to note that any filters in "Customize Form" will override the default filters**

**Eval Support**

Users can add dynamic filters based on some value from the form.

**Use:**

`eval: doc.fieldname`

or

`eval: doc.fieldname1 + doc.fieldname2`

**For Child Tables:**  
2 types of filters can be added.

- From the Child Table Row: to add these filters use `doc.child_table_field_name`
- From Parent Document: to add these use `parent.parent_doc_fieldname`

the expression added after "eval:" is evaluated and its value is returned.

```
Note: Filters applied through frm.set_query, will take preference over filters applied via the User Interface (UI).
```
